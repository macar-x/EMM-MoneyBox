# Cashlens Development Roadmap

**See your money clearly**

## Project Structure
- ✅ Reorganize repository into monorepo structure
- ✅ Move backend code into `backend/` folder
- ✅ Update configuration files for new structure
- ✅ Create `flutter/` folder for Flutter UI

---

## Backend Development

### CLI Infrastructure (Completed ✅)
- ✅ Rebrand from EMM-MoneyBox to Cashlens
- ✅ Version command
- ✅ Cash flow commands (income, outcome, query, delete, update, list, range, summary)
- ✅ Category commands (create, query, delete, update, list)
- ✅ Data management commands (export, import, backup, restore, init, reset, stats)
- ✅ Database commands (connect, seed)
- ✅ Improved help text and command structure
- ✅ CLI documentation (backend/docs/CLI.md)

**Note**: Most new commands have CLI structure in place but need database service implementation.

### Mapper Layer Enhancements (High Priority)

**Update Methods** - Accept entity parameter instead of just ID:
- [ ] Enhance `CashFlowMapper.UpdateCashFlowByEntity(plainId, entity)` in MongoDB mapper
- [ ] Enhance `CashFlowMapper.UpdateCashFlowByEntity(plainId, entity)` in MySQL mapper
- [ ] Enhance `CategoryMapper.UpdateCategoryByEntity(plainId, entity)` in MongoDB mapper
